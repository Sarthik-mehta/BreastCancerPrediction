# Breast-Cancer Prediction System
## About the Project
The core idea behind the project is the requirement of an app to predict the possibility of breast cancer which cannot be cured at later stages and hence it is very crucial to be detected at a premature stage.
This easy-to-use web application uses Random Forest Classifier machine learning algorithm to predict highly accurate results. This web application can easily be used from home for diagnosis of breast cancer by simply filling up the required details in order to predict the possibility of breast cancer.
